/*
State Rules.
Declarations for the appearance of a module in its various states.

Simply put, these states may change in three ways:
- Class name, the change happens by adding or removing a class, usually
with Javascript
- Pseudo-class, the change happens to elements that are descendants or
siblings of the element with the pseudo-class
- Media query, the change happens under defined criteria, such as
different viewport sizes.
